# Poly-Hunter-Blender
A Blender addon that allows one to find the highest poly object in the scene easily with a comprehensive list of poly counts with object names presented instantly.
Look for it in the N panel under JunoTools, enable Predator View and you will be able to hunt based on poly count. Enjoy~!
